## PROJECTS
### **Indoor Location Software Backend & UI (IoT), Puente Technology** — *Architect & Lead Developer*

2019-2020

One of our clients at Puente required a software system to process real-time sensor data to determine precise indoor location for objects/people in motion, trigger various actions and display data to both mobile and desktop users.

We developed a distributed system that continuously receives ~10 MB of data per minute over WiFi, pipes it into Kafka, processes the data in Python, calculates location, stores the results in Cassandra, and finally presents both raw and application level data to users via both web and mobile applications.  We used Elasticsearch for searching system logs and historical location data, Redis for accessing instantaneous data and passing configuration data between processes.  We used Postgres primarily for storing user and system configuration data and we use Django for the web/mobile applications’ GraphQL API backend.

- Frontend: Typescript, React, NextJS, RelayJS, Semantic UI Less
- Mobile: React Native
- Backend: Python, Django, Kafka, Postgres, PostGIS, Redis, Casandra, Elasticsearch
- Deployed to Kubernetes on Digital Ocean / AWS with Github Actions using Docker & Helm
